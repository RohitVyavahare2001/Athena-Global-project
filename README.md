# Athena-Global-project

In this project, we explored predictive modeling techniques to analyze whether a purchase will be made or not. Several models were employed, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Let's dive into the key findings and conclusions from the project:

## Key Findings:
Model Comparison: All models showed good accuracy, except for Naive Bayes. The performance of each model was evaluated, and we observed interesting trends among them.

 Logistic Regression Shines: Among the models tested, Logistic Regression emerged as the star performer, exhibiting higher accuracy compared to others. This model demonstrated promising results, making it a top choice for this predictive task.

## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
By performing hyperparameter tuning on the Logistic Regression model, we were able to achieve an impressive increase in testing accuracy from 78% to 79%, while maintaining training accuracy at 77%. Fine-tuning the model parameters significantly improved its overall performance.

## Conclusions:
 Logistic Regression Dominance: Based on our evaluation, Logistic Regression stood out as the preferred model due to its superior performance. It serves as a strong foundation for predicting whether a purchase will be made or not.

## SVM as a Viable Option: 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) also demonstrated comparable accuracy to Logistic Regression, making it a viable alternative. However, for businesses that prioritize specificity, domain-specific experts should be involved to evaluate metrics like recall, specificity, and F1 score. This will ensure the best choice for making informed business decisions.
